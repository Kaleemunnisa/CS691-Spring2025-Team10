Proposal: AI Powered developer learning platform
Problem Statement and Hypothesis:
In most of the cases many developers, especially beginners who get newly introduced to the coding, struggle with problem solving. Most of the available learning platforms or the AI tools provide the direct solutions instead of offering the structured learning guidance. And this is where our idea comes from. 
We plan to develop a platform where budding developers can sharpen their problem-solving skills by seeking the answers themselves with a series of hints that guides them through the process. We plan to achieve this by integrating open AI, this system ensures that users receive assistance without being directly given the answers, generating critical thinking and deeper understanding of the concept. Our ultimate goal is to improve the coding skills of our target users in a more interactive and engaging way. 
Technologies we plan to use: 
Front end:
Figma – for wireframe design
React.Js- responsive UI framework
Css – styling
Back end: 
Node.js – API and server management
MongoDB – for problem and user data management
AI integration:
Open AI – for adaptive hint generation

Prototype Screens:
This is how we visualized our platform’s structure to be, 
Home page:
Welcome message with introduction to the platform
User Signup/login
Challenge page:
Split screen view with:
o	Problem statement and constraints
o	Code editor for users to write and test solutions
o	AI powered hint system with three levels:
	General Guidance
	Code structure help
	Partial code snippet
User Profile and Progress tracking:
Dashboard displaying completed challenges and achievements
Streaks and badges for motivation

In conclusion, we plan to design an AI-powered developer learning platform with a unique approach to programming education. With an interactive UI and AI integration, our goal is to make it more engaging which in turn improves knowledge retention among the users.
